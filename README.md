## Instructions

Users will start by creating an account by selecting the 'Sign Up' button in the top right of the navigation bar and completing the linked registration form.

New users are routed to the 'New Lib' where they can select a part of the Django Unchained movie script. The 'New Lib' page may also be accessed by clicking the 'New Lib' button in the top right of the navigation bar. Once a part is selected the user may complete a form that consists of a part of speech or description of the type of word that must be input.
